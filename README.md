## Arabic Tools

I built this app to aid in my Arabic studies. Arabic is a complicated language, with lots of different rules.


### Why an app is needed, instead of using practice books

Probably the most complicated part of learning Arabic is grammar. Because of the complexity involved, I decided I need to break up concepts into practiceable parts, with each successive "sentence level" incorporating all prior grammatical concepts. E.g., level one is "she eats". Level two is "she eats vegetables". Level three is "she eats vegetables while eating fruit". 

Unfortunately, arabic practice books do not take this method - they generally scatter concept practice.

Learning arabic without incrementally building on concepts will greatly reduce the efficiency and speed of learning.

Inspiration came from my deep exploration of memory optimized language learning, and an incredibly insightful article ["The 20 Rules of Formulating Knowledge"](https://supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/articles/20rules).
