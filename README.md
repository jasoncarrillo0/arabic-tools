# Arabic Tools

  
### TL;DR
Problem: most Levantine-Arabic grammar and vocab material do not follow memory optimized learning principles. Inspired by my deep exploration of memory-optimized learning and ["The 20 Rules of Formulating Knowledge"](https://supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/articles/20rules), I created an app to fix unorganized vocab and grammar practice, and increase learning speed.


### Features

 1. Upload vocab through CSV files
 2. Admin users: Create, edit, delete practice sentences and vocabulary
 3. Verb conjugation practice components
 4. Sentence practice pages by level of grammar difficulty


### Why I'm learning Arabic
I lived in Lebanon for 3 years and my wife is Lebanese. I want to be able to communicate with Lebanese, and being able to speak another language is awesome! The US doesn't heavily teach languages. My wife can speak Arabic, English, and French, for example.


### Why an app is needed, instead of using practice books
The app presents sentence, verb conjugation, and vocabulary practice in a neuroscientifically optimized way. Grammar practice is optimized to strategically build on prior concepts to reinforce prior learned concepts, not found in the average grammar practice books. Grammar practice also pulls from a limited vocabulary set (very important), and the vocabulary set are objects you will likely see while practicing (e.g., in your house or a coffee shop) and/or draw from the most frequently used words. Vocab was aggregated from multiple data sources. I can ask/hire any Arabic speaker to create and edit sentences and vocabulary if needed.

Probably the most complicated part of learning Arabic is grammar. Because of the complexity involved, I decided I need to break up grammatical concepts into practiceable parts, with each successive "sentence level" incorporating all prior grammatical concepts. E.g., level one is "she eats". Level two is "she eats vegetables". Level three is "she eats vegetables while eating fruit". Each successive level reinforces all prior levels, eliminating forgetfulness. The amount of concepts in the prior sentence examples alone are massive.


I am learning Levantine-Arabic, specifically colloquial Lebanese Arabic.
